# Introduction

Welcome to the AlastairLundy.Extensions.Processes Docs AKA ProcessExtensions!

In this readme, the package AlastairLundy.Extensions.Processes is referred to as ProcessExtensions for brevity.

## What is ProcessExtensions?
ProcessExtensions adds much needed abstractions and extensions to Processes and Process Running, to make it easier and safer.

ProcessExtensions started as part of CliInvoke but is now a separate package, helping other projects besides CliInvoke to run processes easily and safely.

## Getting Started
