## Contributing to the Project

### Suggestions and Bug Reports
If you have either a suggestion or bug report you can file it on this project's [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/alastairlundy/Extensions.Processes/issues/).

### Submitting a Pull Request
If you'd like to add a feature or change part of this project's code, please:
1) Fork this repository
2) Make a new branch from main with a name that very briefly describes the changes you want to make
3) Test the changes to make sure it doesn't break any existing code and works on the Platforms that the project currently works on
4) Submit a Pull Request describing the changes you've made and why you've made them (particularly if it's not immediately apparent or obvious)
5) If I haven't commented on the Pull Request or reviewed it within a few weeks of it being created, please feel free to tag me @alastairlundy in the Pull Request.

If you have multiple features or changes that you want to add that don't rely on each other, please create separate branches for each separate change or feature. 

You might find it duplicative to do this, but it helps to ensure that: 
A) individual changes are accepted or declined based on their own merits
B) code that is submitted to be merged is reviewed and scrutinized carefully to avoid, and/or mitigate against attacks on Open Source code and infrastructure - We don't need a repeat of the xz utils backdoor attack.
and C) code is safely added to this project without causing this package to suffer any regressions as a result of accepting the contribution. 

If you follows these steps, and your contribution makes a helpful change, I am likely to agree to merge it.

Thank you for reading these contribution guidelines.
